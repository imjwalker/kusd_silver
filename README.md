# KUSD: 0% Interest Loans on Koinos

### How Does KUSD Work?

Anyone can deposit KOIN, ETH, or BTC as collateral to mint KUSD. Based on their collateral they can mint kusd.koin, kusd.eth or kusd.btc
A minimum collateralization ratio of 110% is required. If a vault falls below 110%, anyone can liquidate it and receive its collateral plus debt.

For example, if someone mints $1000 worth of KUSD and the collateral value of their vault falls to $1080, the collateralization ratio is now 108%. Anyone can trigger a liquidation and receive $1080 of collateral and $1000 of debt, making a profit of $80.

The owner of the vault still retains the minted KUSD in his wallet. This means the holder of a vault is penalized 10% if his vault gets liquidated.

### How Does KUSD Maintain Stability?

If KUSD falls below $1, vault holders are incentivized to repay their loans since they can purchase KUSD at a cheaper price. Conversely, if KUSD is worth more than $1, anyone can mint KUSD and sell it at a profit on the open market.

### Fees

The frontend charges a one-time 0.5% fee on deposits. Withdrawing collateral, minting KUSD and repaying loans is always free and can be done as often as the user wants.
