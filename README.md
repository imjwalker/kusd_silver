# KUSD: 0% Interest Loans on Koinos

### How Does KUSD Work?

Anyone can deposit KOIN, ETH, BTC, or KAS as collateral to mint KUSD. A minimum collateralization ratio of 110% is required. If a vault falls below 110%, anyone can liquidate it and receive its collateral plus debt.

For example, if someone mints $1000 worth of KUSD and the collateral value of their vault falls to $1080, the collateralization ratio is now 108%. Anyone can trigger a liquidation and receive $1080 of collateral and $1000 of debt, making a profit of $80.

The owner of the vault still retains the minted KUSD in his wallet. This means the holder of a vault is penalized 10% if his vault gets liquidated.

### How Does KUSD Maintain Stability?

If KUSD falls below $1, vault holders are incentivized to repay their loans since they can purchase KUSD at a cheaper price. Conversely, if KUSD is worth more than $1, anyone can mint KUSD and sell it at a profit on the open market.

### KUSD Silver (KUSDS) vs KUSD Gold (KUSDG)

There are two types of KUSD: KUSD Gold and KUSD Silver. Both are worth $1 and function according to the same mechanisms. KUSD Gold exclusively uses Koinos' native KOIN token as collateral, whereas KUSD Silver accepts Ether, Bitcoin, and Kaspa as collateral.

ETH, BTC, and KAS are wrapped, non-native tokens, which technically makes them more vulnerable to hacks. However, in the unlikely event that a hack does occur, the risk won't spread to KUSD Gold because its collateral is kept separately.

### Fees

The frontend charges a one-time 0.3% fee on deposits. Withdrawing collateral, minting KUSD and repaying loans is always free and can be done as often as the user wants.
